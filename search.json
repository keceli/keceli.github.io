    "section": "",
    "text": "I am interested in developing methods and writing codes related to electronic and vibrational structure of molecules and extended systems. Quantum mechanics gives us the formulations required for a quantitative description of the chemical interactions; however, the complexity of these equations grows rapidly with the system size. We need clever algorithms, efficient implementations and powerful computers to be able to solve these equations. There is indeed one more component, data, that can significantly help us in this challenge. High-throughput simulations and experiments provide us big data and the machine learning revolution bring us powerful data analytics tools. I believe that complementing formula-driven approaches with data-driven models will allow us to solve the most challenging scientific problems in the 21st century. Therefore, I am also interested in designing workflows to generate accurate quantum chemistry data and developing tools to analyze and use the data."
