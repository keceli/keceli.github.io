    "text": "I’m a computational scientist at Argonne National Laboratory focused on automating and accelerating quantum chemistry and materials science simulations using AI and supercomputers. I believe these technologies can revolutionize the discovery of new materials and drugs at an unprecedented pace and help us address some of the most urgent challenges of our time—if we use them responsibly and for the greater good. I’m always eager to collaborate with others who share this mission, so please feel free to reach out."
